## New Homepage

My first homepage, which is also my first project, leaves too much to be desired. I wrote a new website with Next.js.
Features:
Next.js
locale & localization
Animated components

## Technical commentary

<ul>
    <li>
        Set up locale with next-i18next. With NextRouter it can be changed inside any function and hook.
